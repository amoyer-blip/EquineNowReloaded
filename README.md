Description
EquineNow, an MVC, allows its users to collect and store data in an efficient and effective manner.  More specifically, EquineNow is tailored for users within the Equine community that rescue horses from auctions to prevent those horses from entering the slaughter pipeline. At auctions and before bringing the horses to rescue, an abundance of detailed information regarding each horse is recorded. This documentation continues throughout the time each horse is at the rescue. EquineNow simplifies this process. 

Table of Contents
The user can add an auction with the auction’s name, location and the date. From there, the user can add a horse with its properties and tie it back to the auction. Auction Details provides a list of all horses from each specific auction. Vet Checks are structured around each individual horse by providing detailed information regarding a horse’s injuries, treatment plan etc.
